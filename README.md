🔁 Palindrome Checker
A simple program that checks whether a given word, phrase, or number is a palindrome — a sequence that reads the same backward as forward (e.g., "madam", "121", "racecar").

🧠 What Is a Palindrome?
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

Examples:
✔️ madam → Palindrome
✔️ A man, a plan, a canal, Panama → Palindrome
❌ hello → Not a palindrome
